# About this project

This is the brainchild of Sam Tyner (@sctyner) and Kiegan Rice (@kiegan), both alumni of the Iowa State University statistics department, one of the oldest in the country. This project is inspired by the discussion surrounding [this twitter thread](https://twitter.com/daniela_witten/status/1268392721275744256?s=20) by Daniela Witten, the Dorothy Gilford Endowed Chair of Mathematical Statistics at the University of Washington. Briefly, the thread is grappling with having our prestigious statistics awards be named after RA Fisher, a eugenicist, and what that means about who we celebrate in our profession. 

Sam and Kiegan feel that we know very little about the history of statistics and the history of the statisticians whose work we rely on every day. This document is intended to be a crowd-sourced collection of resources for statisticians to learn about our own history. Please contribute by filing an issue or a pull request. Note that by contributing to this project you agree to adhere to the contributor code of conduct. Please read it carefully.

## Blogs & Blog posts

*What blogs & blog posts have been written about the history of statistics & statisticians?*

- Daniel Cleather, [Is Statistics Racist?](https://medium.com/swlh/is-statistics-racist-59cd4ddb5fa9)
    * "What is important to realise is that eugenics was far more than just a side interest for Galton, Pearson and Fisher. To a large part their desire to promote the eugenics agenda provided the motivation for their interest in statistics in the first place."
- Nathaniel Joselson, [Eugenics and Statistics, Discussing Karl Pearson and R. A. Fisher](https://njoselson.github.io//Fisher-Pearson/)
    * "In 'The Scope and Importance to the State of National Eugenics,' Pearson wrote that 'human sympathy' for people with genetic 'defects' (ie having mental illness, or being disabled) is undesirable. He said sympathy is an artificial process that goes against the principles of evolution and results in a decrease in the genetic fitness of society as a whole. Thus it is a waste to expend resources on people who are genetically inferior, when these resources could be used to improve people of 'good stock.'"
- Nathaniel Joselson, [Eugenics and Statistics Part Two, Reflections and Implications](https://njoselson.github.io/Eugenics-Reflections/)
    * "Statistical significance, like every other observable phenomenon (gender, sexuality, race), is on a spectrum, not a categorical scale. Post-colonial understanding of statistical significance doesn't rely on p-values less than 0.05, but rather on holistic understanding of the data in question and the mathematical properties of the population that generated it. This is knowledge discovery, not hypothesis testing. This is interdisciplinary research, not isolated extrapolation by inherently biased human beings."
