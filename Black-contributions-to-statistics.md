# Contributions of Black scientists & researchers to Statistics

This page was created for [#ShutDownSTEM](https://www.shutdownstem.com/) on June 10, 2020. 

The structure of the page is as follows: each heading represents a Black statistician, mathematician, scientist, or other researcher who has made important contributions to the field of statistics. Contributions are listed under the heading. There is no particular ordering to the headings. 

This is not meant to be a complete list or static source. It should grow and change. Please contribute by making a pull request or filing an issue.

## [David Blackwell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Blackwell)

#### Fields: game theory, probability theory, information theory, and Bayesian statistics

- [The Rao-Blackwell theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rao%E2%80%93Blackwell_theorem): The Rao–Blackwell theorem states that if g(X) is any kind of estimator of a parameter, then the conditional expectation of g(X) given T(X), where T is a sufficient statistic, is typically a better estimator of the parameter, and is never worse. 

Books:  
- Theory of Games and Statistical Decisions (1954; with M.A. Girshick)
- Basic Statistics (1969): one of the earliest textbooks on Bayesian statistics 

The [Blackwell-Tapia](https://mathinstitutes.org/diversity/blackwell-tapia-conference/) prize recognizes a mathematician who has served as a role model for mathematical scientists and students from underrepresented minority groups or has contributed in other significant ways to addressing the problem of underrepresentation of minorities in mathematics.


## [Albert Turner Bharucha-Reid](http://www.math.buffalo.edu/mad/PEEPS/bharucha-reid_a_t.html)

## [Charles B. Bell, Jr.](https://www.blackpast.org/african-american-history/bell-jr-charles-b-1928/)

#### Fields: nonparametric statistics, stochastic processes and related application areas

Authored [many papers](http://www.math.buffalo.edu/mad/PEEPS/bell_charlesb.html) on distrbution-free (nonparametric) statistics, on the topics of: 
- structure of distribution-free statistics,
- characterization of multi-sample distribution-free statistics,
- optimal one-sample distribution-free tests,
- distribution-free tests of independence, and 
- distribution-free tests of randomness.

Also collaborated with David Blackwell. 

## [W.E.B. DuBois](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/W._E._B._Du_Bois)

#### Fields: sociology, history 

Created [The American Negro](https://publicdomainreview.org/collection/w-e-b-du-bois-hand-drawn-infographics-of-african-american-life-1900), an exhibit at the World Fair in 1900 in Paris which included dozens of **data visualizations** about the lives of Black people in the United States at the turn of the century, 35 years after the end of slavery. [See all visualizations at the Library of Congress online archive.](http://www.loc.gov/pictures/search/?q=%22lot%2011931%22%20NOT%20medal&st=grid&co=anedub&loclr=blogpic)

## [Tommy Wright](https://www.census.gov/research/researchers/profile.php?cv_sub=div&cv_profile=3743)

#### Fields: probability sampling, sample design, official statistics

[Amstat News Feature in February 2020](https://magazine.amstat.org/blog/2020/02/01/tommy-wright/)

Led the [Center for Statistical Research and Methodology (CSRM)](https://www.census.gov/srd/csrm/) at the [U.S. Census Bureau](https://www.census.gov/), and his team took on the challenges in providing official statistics to the people and businesses.

## [Lorin Crawford](https://vivo.brown.edu/display/lcrawfo1)

#### Fields: Bayesian statistics, deep learning, genetics, machine learning, and nonparametric statistics

At Brown University, Dr. Crawford leads a team to build machine learning algorithms that help scientists understand the complex interactions between different genetic features, in order to better understand genetic disorders.  

Dr. Crawford is featured in [Forbes 30 under 30 in 2019](https://www.forbes.com/profile/lorin-crawford/) for his research in the intersection of genetics and statistics.  

Dr. Crawford is also listed in the [The Root: 100 Most Influential African Americans in 2019](https://interactives.theroot.com/root-100-2019/lorin-crawford/).

## [Olanrewaju Michael Akande](https://datascience.duke.edu/olanrewaju-michael-akande)

#### Fields: Bayesian statistics, missing data imputation, mixture models, and hierarchical modeling

Dr. Akande is part of the faculty at Duke MIDS (Master in Interdisciplinary Data Science). Given that Dr. Akande completed a PhD in 2019, he has high potential in research, particularly in developing Bayesian models to impute missing data and edit erroneous responses in surveys.

#### Fields: business intelligence, data analytics, social media, and cybersecurity

Dr. Marshall is the founder and CEO of [DataedX Group](https://www.dataedx.com/), whose focus is to expose and mitigate the harmful impact of data practices on technology and society. She is also a full professor in computer science at [Spelman College](https://www.spelman.edu/about-us/news-and-events/our-stories/stories/2017/07/10/brandeis-marshall). Dr. Marshall published [*Data Conscience: Algorithmic Siege on our Humanity*](https://www.brandeismarshall.com/book) in 2022 to intersect social justice with data science.
